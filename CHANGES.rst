Changelog for Charlatan
=======================

0.4.6 (2015-09-22)
------------------

- Add support for ``epoch_now_in_ms`` (thanks to @chunyan)

0.4.5 (2015-05-29)
------------------

- Add ``deep_inherit`` to allow nested inheritance of fields.

0.4.4 (2015-05-28)
------------------

- Added ``!now_naive`` YAML file command to return naive datetime.

0.4.3 (2015-05-26)
------------------

- Fixed anonymous list objects name resolution (thanks to @jvrsantacruz)

0.4.2 (2015-05-19)
------------------

- **Breaking change**: the ``!now`` YAML command now returns timezone-aware
  datetime by default. You can change that behavior by changing
  `charlatan.file_format.TIMEZONE_AWARE`.
- Fixed bug where uninstalling a sqlalchemy fixture would not commit the delete
  to the session.
- Fixed bug where dict fixtures could not reference fields from other collections of dicts.

0.4.1 (2015-02-26)
------------------

- Fixed bug where ``!rel a_database_model.id``, where ``id`` is a primary key
  generated by the database, would be ``None`` because of how fixtures are
  cached.
- Removed ``as_list`` and ``as_dict`` feature. It was unnecessarily complex and
  would not play well with caching fixtures.

0.4.0 (2015-02-18)
------------------

- **Breaking change**: ``get_builder`` and ``delete_builder`` arguments were
  added to :py:class:`charlatan.FixturesManager`.
- **Breaking change**: ``delete_instance``, ``save_instance`` methods were
  deleted in favor of using builders (see below).
- **Breaking change**: ``fields`` argument on
  :py:class:`charlatan.fixture.Fixture` and fixtures collection class has
  been renamed ``overrides`` for consistency reasons.
- **Breaking change**: ``attrs`` argument on
  :py:class:`charlatan.FixturesManager` been renamed ``overrides`` for
  consistency reasons.
- **Breaking change**: deleting fixtures will not return anything. It used to
  return the fixture or list of fixtures that were successfully deleted. It has
  been removed to apply the command query separation pattern. There are other
  ways to check which fixtures are installed, and hooks or builders can be used
  to customize deletion.
- **Breaking change**: ``do_not_save`` and ``do_not_delete`` arguments have
  been removed from all functions, in favor of using builders.
- The notion of :py:class:`charlatan.builder.Builder` was added. This allows
  customizing how fixtures are instantiated and installed. A ``builder``
  argument has been added to most method dealing with getting, installing or
  deleting fixtures. Sane defaults have been added in most places.
- Improve documentation about using pytest with charlatan.
- Fix bug preventing being able to load multiple fixtures file.

0.3.12 (2015-01-14)
-------------------

- Do not install the class' ``fixtures`` variable on
  :py:class:`charlatan.FixturesManagerMixin` initialization. This can lead to
  bad pattern where a huge list of fixtures is installed for each test, even
  though each test uses only a few. Also, it's safer to be explicit about this
  behavior and let the user have this automatic installation. Note that you can
  easily reimplement this behavior by subclassing or installing those in the
  class ``setUp`` method.

0.3.11 (2015-01-06)
-------------------

- Fix getting relationships with fields that are nested more than one level

0.3.10 (2014-12-31)
-------------------

- Get ``utcnow`` at fixture instantiation time, to allow using ``freezegun``
  intuitively

------------------

- Fix saving collection of fixtures to database (thanks to @joegilley)
