   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to Charlatan's documentation!
=====================================

**Efficiently manage and install data fixtures**

Charlatan is a library that you can use in your tests to create database
fixtures. Its aim is to provide a pragmatic interface that focuses on making it
simple to define and install fixtures for your tests. It is also agnostic in so
far as even though it's designed to work out of the box with SQLAlchemy models,
it can work with pretty much anything else.

**Why Charlatan?** Since "charlatan" used to define "an itinerant seller of
supposed remedies", we thought it would be a good name for a library providing
fixtures for tests. Credit for the name goes to Zack Heller.
